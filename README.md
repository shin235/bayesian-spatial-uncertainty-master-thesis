# Spatial Uncertainty Quantification in DeepKriging: A Bayesian Approach

This repository was developed as part of my Master’s thesis at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.

It implements a probabilistic deep learning pipeline to predict PM2.5 concentrations across the United States. The model builds on Bayesian deep learning techniques to quantify predictive uncertainty.
